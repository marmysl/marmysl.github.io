## Personal Website

Welcome! 
I wanted to create a platform where I could document my side projects while also learning some new skills (Ruby + Jekyll + Github Pages) and improving some old ones (HTML + CSS).

## Credit
This awesome theme was developed by [Jami Gibbs](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom).
I made some slight changes to the templates because jekyll-paginate-v2 is not supported by Github Pages. 
I used the plugin jekyll-paginate instead!
