## Welcome to my page!

My name is Maria and I'm a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying **Computer Engineering**. 

I hope you don't mind the current state of this page... beta version. 

I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new things and develop for the web! So, if you're interested in reaching out to me, {% include contact.html %}{% include contact-modal.html %}
